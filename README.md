## For Sublime Text users

If you use Sublime Text 3 or above, you can run `bash install.sh` to collect the snippets to `build` directory and manually copy it to Sublime Text 3 user directory.

If you use MacOS and installed Sublime Text to the default location, then the script may detect it and copy the snippets for you.

If you wish to customize the list of snippets, you may modify `install.txt` in each snippet subdirectory before running the script.
